# ProjectO - Transforming Perspectives, One Paw at a Time! 🐾📱

Exciting news, everyone! I'm thrilled to unveil "ProjectO" - my latest project aimed at reshaping society's perception of stray dogs through technology and compassion! 🌟🐕

With "ProjectO," our mission is simple yet profound: to bridge the gap between stray dogs and communities by fostering understanding, empathy, and positive interactions. Here's what you can expect from "ProjectO":

🔹 **Low Wireframe Prototype:** Our initial design in Figma lays the foundation for an intuitive and user-friendly app interface, ensuring seamless navigation and engagement.

🔹 **Community Engagement:** Connecting people with stray dogs to help change their perspective towards strays.

Join us in our mission to create a world where every stray dog is seen, valued, and embraced with open arms! 🌍🐶

I'm incredibly passionate about "ProjectO" and its potential to make a meaningful impact on our communities. Let's collaborate and make a difference together! 💬🐾

🔹 **Project Update (22-05-2024):** 

**Enable Login feature:** We are glad to inform you that we have added a user-friendly login system to our app, built on the Firebase platform. As beginners, it was challenging for us to choose the type of login system that is both easy to use and intuitive for users. Since our app is designed for mobile devices, OTP login seemed perfect for us. However, it was challenging to implement due to some deprecated APIs. Nonetheless, we have been working tirelessly, 24/7, to fix our bugs, and we have successfully added this functionality.

🔹 **Project Update (30-05-2024):** 

**Add Resend Code feature:** We're excited to announce the latest addition to our login experience - the Resend Code feature!
After days of dedicated effort, we've integrated a seamless Resend Code functionality into our login screen, powered by Firebase OTP Authentication. Now, users can effortlessly request a new verification code if they haven't received it or if their previous code has expired.

🔹 **Project Update (01-06-2024):** 

**Network CallBack feature:** We are glad to inform you that we have added a network callback feature to our app. If a user loses their internet connection, they will now receive an alert, helping them to enable their internet before accessing the login screen.

🔹 **Project Update (02-06-2024):** 

**New Launcher Icon:** We are thrilled to announce the addition of a new launcher icon to our app! This icon has been thoughtfully designed to embody the essence of our brand and enhance the app's visual appeal.
